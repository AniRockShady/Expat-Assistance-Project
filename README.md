# Expat-Assistance-Project
The following idea starting from the proposal is based on developing a website which will be dedicated to assist the Expats in Poland with legal advice. <br>
The main motive is to setup a dedicated platform where expats can have dedicated services based on their issues due to the ever-changing immigration policies, rules, and approach.
## Framework Overview
The backend framework was built using the Python as the coding language and the SQL as the database management system. The complete version of the programming and development will be carried out using the Jupyter Notebook as the integrated development environment (IDE) for Python and SQLlite will be used as the database engine. Additionally, Flask is chosen as the web framework for the webpage development in this project. The page optimization and development is done in html using Bootstrap, CSS and JS. <br>
